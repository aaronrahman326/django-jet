Installation
============

.. note::
    After following this instruction Django JET dashboard won't be active (as it is located into
    a separate application). If you want to make it work, you will have to enable dashboard application
    by following :doc:`install_dashboard` steps too.

* Download and install latest version of Django JET:

.. code:: python

    pip install django-jet
    # or
    easy_install django-jet

* Add 'jet' application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your Django project settings.py file (note it should be before 'django.contrib.admin'):

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'jet',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        ...
    )

* Make sure 'django.core.context_processors.request' context processor is enabled in settings.py:

.. code:: python

    from django.conf import global_settings

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
        'django.core.context_processors.request',
    )

* Add URL-pattern to the urlpatterns of your Django project urls.py file (they are needed for relatedâ€“lookups and autocompletes):

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^jet/', include('jet.urls', 'jet')),  # Django JET URLS
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
    )

* Create database tables:

.. code:: python

    python manage.py migrate jet
    # or
    python manage.py syncdb

* Collect static if you are in production environment:

.. code:: python

        python manage.py collectstatic

* Clear your browser cache
