Dashboard
=========

Django JET Dashboard tries to be as compatible as possible with django-admin-tools dashboard so that
django-admint-tools modules could be easily ported to Django JET. In most cases in will be enough to
change python imports in dashboard.py and remove extending in modules templates.

More info incoming.
